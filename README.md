# Finding Lane Lines on the Road

The goal of this project is making a pipeline to detect the lane lines on the road. For this purpose, computer vision techniques are used with a series of transformations to predict left and right lane lines on the road.

Please see the [report](report.md) for details of the pipeline and the results.
